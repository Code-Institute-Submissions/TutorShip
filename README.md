### Surface

#### Tone/Colours

The landing/home page is vibrant, colourful and engaging.

The design is clean, minimal and refined.

Tones of purple are offset with bright orange and green, evoking a sense of quality and comfort.

White is used for the body background colour for easy readability and allows the graphics, imagery and information take centre stage.

#### Typography

A single sans serif font is used throughout the site - colour, weight and size create the visual hierarchy.

Font used :
* [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins)

The font is linked from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) in the Style Sheet.

#### Animation

Subtle fade-in animations are triggered on scroll which provide an engaging experience.

## Testing
Various methods of testing were used throughout all stages of development.

All methods of testing can be viewed within the [testing.md](https://github.com/JustinMcC066/TutorShip/blob/master/testing.md) file.

## Deployment
Visual Studio Code IDE was used to develop the website. The code was committed to git and pushed to GitHub within Visual Studio Code.

The site is hosted and deployed through [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). The Heroku app is connected to the Git Repository and updates automatically as new commits are pushed to Github.

To deploy this site the following steps were taken:

1. A```Procfile``` was created inform Heroku what type of app is being deployed. Inside the Procfile insert ```web: python <your_app_name>.py```.
2. A ```requirements.txt``` was created using the the command ```sudo pip freeze > requirements.txt```. This holds all the dependencies used in the app.
3. A env.py was created to store the MONGO_DBNAME, MONGO_URI and SECRET_KEY. This was linked to from the main app.py file.
4. These files were then committed to the TutorShip Git Repository.
5. A Heroku account was set up and a new App created using a unique name and choosing a region.
7. The *config vars* were then configured in the settings section of the Heroku app.
8. The Heroku app was then connected to the git repository allowing the app to update/build as new commits are pushed to the repository.

The live site can be viewed here: [TutorShip](https://tutorship-app.herokuapp.com/)

### Local

*Please note: You will need to install the following in order to run this app on your local machine:*
*A virtual environment is also recommended for development.*

- Git
- MongoDB
- Python 3
- PIP

1. Navigate to [https://github.com/JustinMcC066/TutorShip.git](https://github.com/JustinMcC066/TutorShip.git)

```
6. Install the required dependencies for this project by running the following command in your terminal:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
6. Create an env.py file to store your MONGO_DBNAME, MONGO_URI and SECRET_KEY.
The env file should include the following:
```
import os

os.environ["MONGO_URI"] = "mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>.@<cluster_name>.w9nsx.mongodb.net/<database_name>?retryWrites=true&w=majority"
os.environ["MONGO_DBNAME"] = "<MONGO_DB_NAME>"
os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "<SECRET_KEY>"
```
7. For development and debugging, set the debug=True in the app.py file.

#### To deploy the app, follow the steps below:

1. Commit all files to your Git Repository.
2. Sign up and log in to Heroku.
3. ```Create new app``` in Heroku using a unique name. Select your region and create your app.
4. Connect your Github Repo to the Heroku app from the app dashboard on Heroku.
5. From the app dashboard on Heroku select *Settings* and then click *Reveal Config Vars*.
6. Set the following key/value settings for the config vars - see below

#### Heroku Config Vars

T|Key   | Value   |
    |:-:|:-:|
    | IP  |0.0.0.0 |
    | PORT  | 5000  |
    | MONGO_DBNAME  | <YOUR_DB_NAME>  |
    | MONGO_URI  | ```mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>.@<cluster_name>.w9nsx.mongodb.net/<database_name>?retryWrites=true&w=majority```   |
